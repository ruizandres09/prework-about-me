      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a curious person who likes to tinker and figure out how things work. My curiousity for how things work led me to pursue a BS in Mechanical Engineering. I learned a lot but still want to learn more about software development which has led me to join the UCLA Extensions Coding bootcamp.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Puebla, Mexico and rasied in San Bernardino, California.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My hobbies include anything that involves trying new experiences such as: cooking new dishes, trying to learn something like surfing, and making different cocktails. I also like to read non-fiction books about finance, psychology, biographies and others. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy tackling challenging problems that require various approaches to solve. This can include working with multiple softwares, engineering disciplines, and people with completely different skill sets. I would like to work in an environment that encourages that type of work so the job title is not as important. My experience working at multiple tech start ups has provided me with the opportunity to wear multipe hats. .</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Watts within the Los Angeles County. </p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Within my experience working in various tech startups as a mechanical engineer, I have noticed the ever increasing demand for a proficient coding skill set. I want to be able to have this skill set in my set of engineering tools to tackle challenges I may face in the future.</p>
